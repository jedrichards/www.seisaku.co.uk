Rockabox are technical leaders in the programmatic ad-delivery and real time bidding space. In the
summer of 2014 together with [Pete Goodman](http://petegoodman.com/) and
[Matt Collins](http://mcollins.co.uk/) of the [Comrades](http://www.madebycomrades.com) I joined
their experienced Agile product team for over 4 months to help plan and build the next version of a
key internal web app.

I led the frontend development effort on a large AngularJS single page web app with an extensive
unit and functional / e2e test suite. The app was part of a componentised Python backend
architecture and ran off a REST API.

Rockabox CTO Simon Booth said these kind words about us:

> Matt, Jed and Pete worked in-house with us on our core product - a critical piece for our
business. They were an absolute pleasure to work with - professional, knowledgeable and insightful,
and they quickly became key members of a well-established team. They are top of my list for any
future projects - the whole team would love to work with them again.
