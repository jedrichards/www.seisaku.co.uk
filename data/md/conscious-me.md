Together with [Pete Goodman](http://petegoodman.com) and [Mike Allanson](http://michaelallanson.com)
of the [Comrades](http://www.madebycomrades.com) we helped [sme.sh](http://sme.sh/) and their
in-house developers plan and implement a innovative single page app to help a startup social
network demonstrate their business idea to investors.

The web app turned out to be a pretty full-featured social network, containing user posts, infinite
scrolling, user following, visualisation of dynamic social geo-data on a map, commenting, like
buttons and integrations with other social networks. I led the development effort on the Backbone +
Marionette single page app which featured a heavily automated Grunt build process, while sme.sh
developed a Python REST API as a fully separate component. This separations of concerns between
front and backend led to a pretty frictionless and pleasurable development process.

Founder and CEO of sme.sh Tom Quick was nice enough to make the following endorsement of our work:

> Pete, Jed and Mike were able to quickly organise themselves into a highly productive frontend dev
team to help us plan and deliver a single page web app for a startup social network client while
working closely with our in-house producer and backend devs. Despite a quick turn around and tight
budget the quality of their work was excellent throughout the build.
