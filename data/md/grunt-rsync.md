[grunt-rsync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-rsync) and its sister package
[rsyncwrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsyncwrapper) are two npm modules that I actively
maintain on GitHub. I created these packages a few years ago while starting out with Node.js and npm
and I had a need to make use of the rsync tool as part of a Grunt-based deployment pipeline.

With the benefit of increased experience I now question the wisdom of wrapping a cli tool like rsync
in Node.js, but nevertheless the plugin scratches an itch for many and it's downloaded over 3K times
per month and I've received many contributions and pull requests. It was a great opportunity for
some active experience in the GitHub open source community.
