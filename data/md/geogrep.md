GeoGrep are a startup in the geo-search and location SaaS space. In the winter of 2013
[Pete Goodman](http://petegoodman.com) and I helped them develop a prototype single page web app to
demonstrate their backend infrastructure and break into the Indian property search market.

Using Backbone + Marionette and the Leaflet JavaScript mapping library we were able to produce a
highly usable prototype property search web app in the style of sites such as Rightmove that has
since evolved into a cornerstone of successful business in India.

Founder of GeoGrep Kannan Rasappan said this about our work:

> Pete and Jed worked with us to develop the first version of our one page web app during the
initial stage of our business. We were really pleased with the quality of their work, it allowed us
to concentrate on scaling our business which is now a great success. They understand and foresee the
current and future requirements. We haven't had to change much of the web app to this date - though
it was supposed to be a prototype. The current developers have a high regard for them. The
experience of working with them was more than pleasant.
