Decoded are one of the front-runners in the emerging professional digital education space, and in
winter 2014 together with the rest of the [Comrades!](http://www.madebycomrades.com) I helped to
provide Agile process consultancy while implementing a new key part of their web-based business
software.

Decoded's co-founder Alasdair Blackwell had this to say about the experience of working with the
Comrades:

> Working with Matt, Mike, Jed and Pete was a joyful experience. Their combination of cutting-edge experience, process, professionalism and technical ability led to an atmosphere of trust and confidence and a regular stream of high-quality pull requests. The resulting software is robust and scaleable, and has made our business better. Couldn't recommend them enough.
