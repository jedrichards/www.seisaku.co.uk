Working for [RES](http://madebyres.com) alongside [Mike Allanson](http://michaelallanson.com) and with consultation from [Richard Hallows](http://richardhallows.com) we helped a business create a modern component-based CSS style guide and framework for use in a refresh of their critical software products.

We based the CSS architecture on the [SUIT CSS](https://suitcss.github.io) methodology, which favors adaptability, simplicity and maintainability at the expense of DRYness and abstraction. We avoided the use of CSS preprocessors, and instead wrote future-facing plain CSS using [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss). We also set up a Codeship deployment pipeline that deploys the style guide site, bumps the project's semver and releases a new version of the CSS for consumption within the business as a Bower component.
