ES6 is the next version of JavaScript. It brings many interesting new features that push JavaScript closer towards being a mature and powerful functional language. Many of its features are available now in the latest versions of Node and io.js. And by using transpilers like Babel.js we can write ES6 syntax in today's browsers.

I've started to write some documentation on the new features [here](https://github.com/jedrichards/es6), so please take a look. And feel free to PR if you spot something not quite right :)
